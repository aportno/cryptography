# Frequency stability property
Coined by Richard von Mises in 1919, the frequency stability property defines an infinite sequence of zeros and ones as not biased (i.e. random) if the frequency of zeroes goes to 1/2 and every subsequence we can select from it by a "proper" method of selection is also not biased.

* 000 should be as frequent as 111, 101, 010, etc
* if the frequency of a subsequence dominates then the generator is not random
